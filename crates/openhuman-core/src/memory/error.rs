//! The memory RPC error taxonomy.
//!
//! Every `openhuman.memory_*` failure carries one of seven stable codes in its
//! structured error `data.code` (and `data.kind`): `MEMORY_OFF`,
//! `UNSUPPORTED`, `INVALID_REQUEST`, `UNAUTHORIZED`, `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS`,
//! `UNAVAILABLE` or `ENGINE`. The two account-wide refusals are split out of
//! `ENGINE` so a caller can tell "top up" and "try again later" apart from an
//! engine fault, and neither from an empty memory (#6718). Messages never
//! carry a credential: engine errors are already sanitised by TinyMemory, and
//! the host adds only ids and reasons.
