/**
 * Routed onboarding flow.
 *
 *   welcome ─┬─ TinyHumans session → completeAndExit → /chat
 *            └─ local session      → /custom/inference → search → vault → /chat
 *
 * `runtime-choice` is gone: the identity question is asked once on the
 * Welcome screen (`pages/Welcome.tsx`) as two cards, so asking it again three
 * screens later was the same question twice. Its page and step files stay on
 * disk, unrouted.
 *
 * Each custom step asks Default (let OpenHuman manage it) vs Configure
 * (let me pick). Default is a one-click pick; Configure renders inline
 * controls (or a deep-link callout to Settings, for domains not yet
 * embedded). A local session skips the choice entirely and always configures.
 *
 * Voice, OAuth and embeddings are retired: six steps before a first message
 * was a forced tour of Settings, and all three stay reachable from Settings.
 * Their page files are kept unrouted so reviving a step is a route entry
 * rather than a rewrite. (An older note here claimed the same for the
 * Gmail/Composio and context steps, but those files are gone — the claim was
 * stale, so treat keeping these as a choice to confirm, not a convention.)
